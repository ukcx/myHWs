This code takes the video file's name and error rate as inputs from the user.
The bits of the video frames will be changed as much as error rate permits (Higher error rate means more corruption, more changes of the bits).
Written video file is the corrupted version of the input video file with respect to error rate.(if error_rate = 0.7 then video file is 70% corrupted)
You can change output video file's name by changing 'myVideo' to any name in "myVideoFile = VideoWriter('myVideo','MPEG-4');"
If you erase 'MPEG-4' in "myVideoFile = VideoWriter('myVideo','MPEG-4');" the output video file will be in avi format (by default it is mp4).
